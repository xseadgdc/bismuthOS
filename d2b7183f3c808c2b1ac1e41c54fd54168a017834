      "message": "Not yet. We planned to only enable the plugin for active dev branches to avoid the issue of stale OWNERS files in pinned branches.\n\nMy plans for a branch ownership system will provide a frictionless way for branch owners to override in-tree OWNERS, so when that launches we can remove all of these special cases and just enable the plugin everywhere.",
